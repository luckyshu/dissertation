Positioning is based on received power levels, which are converted to distance estimates according to a simple propagation model. The extended Kalman filter computes a 3D position estimate on the basis of distance estimates. With the used Bluetooth hardware, the mean absolute error of positioning was measured to be 3.76 m. The accuracy can be improved if Bluetooth devices are able to measure received power levels more precisely.},

	Abstract = { Designing and developing location-aware portable software applications is challenging, since most location-estimation methods i) require non-standard features either in the mobile terminal or in the network infrastructure, and ii) they are specifically designed for either indoor or outdoor. Moreover, installing and tuning systems that rely on such location methods may be quite a complex operation. In this paper we propose a software architecture that makes a combined use of indoor and outdoor location-sensing technologies. On top of the architecture there is a generic API, aimed at supporting the development of hybrid (indoor/outdoor) applications at a high level of abstraction, independent of the location technology. The API is meant to support applications for which the exact position of a mobile terminal is not a primary requirement, but it suffices to identify the terminal position in a known set of zones (e.g., rooms indoor, or pre-defined outdoor areas). The software architecture is designed: i) to ensure compliance with emerging positioning standards and commercial devices, in order to leverage the interoperability with third-party developed services, and ii) to be based on low-cost and easily deployable and tunable indoor positioning infrastructures. An implementation of the architecture is described, based on Bluetooth and GPS technologies, so as to outline the major implementation issues.},

These systems have been successfully used in many applications such as asset tracking and inventory management. This paper provides an overview of the existing wireless indoor positioning solutions and attempts to classify different techniques and systems. Three typical location estimation schemes of triangulation, scene analysis, and proximity are analyzed. We also discuss location fingerprinting in detail since it is used in most current system or solutions. We then examine a set of properties by which location systems are evaluated, and apply this evaluation method to survey a number of existing systems. Comprehensive performance comparisons including accuracy, precision, complexity, scalability, robustness, and cost are presented.},

This paper proposes the use of measured signal strength of Ethernet packets as a sensor for a localization system. We demonstrate that off-the-shelf hardware can accurately be used for location sensing and real-time tracking by applying a Bayesian localization framework.},

	Abstract = { We present a WLAN location determination technique, the Joint Clustering technique, that uses: (1) signal strength probability distributions to address the noisy wireless channel, and (2) clustering of locations to reduce the computational cost of searching the radio map. The Joint Clustering technique reduces computational cost by more than an order of magnitude, compared to the current state of the art techniques, allowing non-centralized implementation on mobile clients. Results from 802.11-equipped iPAQ implementations show that the new technique gives user location to within 7 feet with over 90% accuracy.},

	Abstract = { A Bluetooth wireless indoor position-measurement system is described. Normal Bluetooth operation uses receiver signal strength indicator (RSSI) for automatic transmitter power control to ensure satisfactory received signal-to-noise ratio. This feedback system was disabled and a novel use of RSSI allowed a series of measurements to be made. The distance was estimated between a reference transmitter and a mobile receiver, using a line-of-sight radio propagation model within a single cell. The design, implementation and evaluation of the system demonstrated that a mean absolute range error of 1.2 m was feasible in the presence of multipath fading.},
