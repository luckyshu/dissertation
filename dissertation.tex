% Sample Notre Dame Thesis/Dissertation
% Using Donald Peterson's ndthesis classfile
%
% Written by Jeff Squyres and Don Peterson
%
% Provided by the Information Technology Committee of
%   the Graduate Student Union
%   http://www.gsu.nd.edu/
%
% Nothing in this document is serious except the format.  :-)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% This is *not* a substitute for Donald's orginial documentation.  See
% /afs/nd.edu/usr/local/src/tex/texmf/doc/latex/ndthesis/ndthesis.dvi
% for documentation on the particular commands and whatnot.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% You should *also* have a ND formatting guide to ensure that you have
% all the relevant parts, put the captions in the right place, etc.
% Just because you have this wonderful style classfile doesn't mean
% that it removes *all* the formatting onus from you.  :-)
%
% Normally, you should break all of this stuff up into separate files
% (at the very least, one chapter per file) and use the \input
% command.  This is all one file for brevity's (and clarity's) sake.
%
% Note that you should also have a good Makefile; one that invokes
% LaTeX as many times as necessary (up to 4) and bibtex if necessary.
% One should be included in this distribution.  You may want to modify
% the Makefile to make separate chapters, if necessary.
%
% If you have any suggestions, comments, questions, please send e-mail
% to: ndthesis@gsu.nd.edu

\begin{acknowledge}
I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Aaron Striegel, who helped provide
direction and guidance for this work. Without his trust and support, I would not have had the opportunity to work in such great research projects. I would also like to thank the members of my committee, Dr. Christian Poellabauer, Dr. David Hachen and Dr. Gregory Madey, who were more than generous with their expertise and precious time.

I also need to thank all my colleagues who create such a good atmosphere in the group;
Andrew Blaich, Yingxin Jiang, Dirk Van Bruggen, Lei Meng, Xueheng Hu, Benjamin Bockdtege, and Rachael Purta.  Also Margaret, Tylor and Michael, deserve a special thanks because their great help in the Netsense project. I need to further thank all my dear friends, Nikhil, Hongsheng, Chris, Pramita, Sal, Jun, Yihua and Mehrdad, for being there for me throughout the entire doctorate program.
